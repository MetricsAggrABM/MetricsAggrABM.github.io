<p>The purpose of humankind on Earth is to try to understand who we are and, to my mind, more importantly, why we are the way we are. All disciplines of the humanities aim to achieve this objective, including economics.</p>

<p>I started my journey by completing an undergraduate degree in labor economics, which was insightful. It made me realize that, along with a strong grasp of theoretical concepts, it is also of utmost importance to truly understand how the tools used to test these theories work. This realization incentivized me to pursue studies in statistics and econometrics during my master’s program.</p>

<p>I earned a master’s degree in economics with a specialization in econometrics from the University of Konstanz, Germany, where I received meticulous training not only in classical econometrics but also in machine learning and statistical inference.</p>

<p>Ever since I conducted my first data analysis, I have been captivated by what else data can reveal. That is why I am currently exploring different approaches and techniques, as an increasing variety of data becomes available to us daily. My toolkit includes time series analysis, machine learning, and statistical learning.</p>

<p>Moreover, in our day and age, it is crucial to convey complex, data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders in a concise and organized manner. This is a valuable skill that can be acquired, and I am very passionate about it. It is not enough to develop technical solutions and share them with our peers; we, as data professionals, should be able to communicate our findings effectively with "laypeople."</p>

<p>Join me in this exciting journey of data exploration and analysis, with the ultimate goal of learning more about how human societies operate in the dawn of the 21st century.</p>
