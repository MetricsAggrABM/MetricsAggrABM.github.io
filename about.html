<p>The purpose of humankind on Earth not just to understand who we are but, more importantly, why we are the way we are. This quest is central to all humanities disciplines, and economics is no exception.</p>

<p>From the moment I conducted my first data analysis during my undergraduate degree in labor economics, I have been captivated by what data can reveal. It made me realize that, along with a solid grasp of theoretical concepts, it is crucial to master the tools needed to test these theories. This realization motivated me to pursue studies in statistics and econometrics during my masterâ€™s program.</p>

<p>I earned my master degree at the University of Konstanz in Germany, specializing in econometrics. I received meticulous training not only in classical econometrics but also in machine learning and statistical inference.</p>

<p>It is that initial captivation with data analysis that has me currently exploring different approaches and techniques, as we now have an ever increasing variety of data. My toolkit includes, but not limited to, time series analysis, machine learning, and statistical learning.</p>

<p>In todays world, it is essential to convey complex, data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders in a concise and organized manner. This non technical skill set is one I am very passionate about as it is not enough to develop only technical solutions. We, as data professionals, should be able to communicate our findings effectively to people from different fields to assure the maximum impact of our research.</p>

<p>Join me in this exciting journey of data exploration and analysis, with the ultimate goal of learning more about how human societies operate in the early 21st century.</p>
